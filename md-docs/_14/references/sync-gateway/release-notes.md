__Known Issues__

- [__#2341__](https://github.com/couchbase/sync_gateway/issues/2341) Channel_index bucket authentication requires username

__Sync Gateway Accelerator Known Issues__

- [Sync Gateway Accel does not recover when removing a node from Couchbase Server Cluster](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sync-gateway-accel/issues/17): removing a node from the Couchbase Server Cluster can cause Sync Gateway Accel to fail. Restarting the Accel node resolves the issue.
- [Client Rollback Support](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sync-gateway-accel/issues/10): when Couchbase Server issues a rollback, Sync Gateway Accel handles that rollback and rolls back the data in the channel index bucket. However, we're not yet invalidating client sequence/since values that were sent to clients pre-rollback. As a result, clients may miss documents written to sequence values in the rollback window.
- [Add Index Document Inspection REST API](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sync-gateway-accel/issues/126): the majority of the index bucket contents are stored as binary documents. Getting a human-readable version of the contents of these documents would be very useful while debugging some types of issues.

__Deprecation notices__

The following features are being deprecated in 1.4 and will be unsupported in an upcoming version (2.x) of Couchbase 
Mobile.

- Bucket Shadowing
